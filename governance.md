# Northbridge Chain — Governance Model (v0.1)
Status: DRAFT (to be frozen before mainnet)
Last updated: 2026

This document defines how protocol changes are proposed, approved, and activated.

Governance must balance:
- Security
- Stability
- Decentralization
- Upgradeability

---

## 1. Governance Objectives

Northbridge Chain governance must:

- Prevent unilateral control
- Allow protocol evolution
- Protect against rushed upgrades
- Maintain deterministic stability

Security > speed of change.

---

## 2. Governance Participants

Primary participants:

1) Validators
2) Token holders (if enabled)
3) Core development team (early phase)

Governance power structure will evolve over time.

---

## 3. Proposal Types

Governance proposals may include:

- Parameter changes (fees, staking)
- Validator set rules
- Consensus parameter adjustments
- Software upgrade activation
- Emergency protocol actions (strictly limited)

Each proposal must include:

- Clear description
- Technical diff (if applicable)
- Risk assessment
- Activation timeline

---

## 4. Voting Model (To Finalize in v0.2)

Options under consideration:

A) Validator-only voting
B) Token-weighted governance
C) Hybrid model (validators + token holders)

Design constraints:

- Avoid plutocracy
- Avoid validator oligopoly
- Maintain security-first posture

---

## 5. Proposal Lifecycle

1) Draft phase
2) Public discussion period
3) Formal submission
4) Voting period
5) Approval threshold check
6) Activation delay
7) Activation at specified block height

Upgrades must never activate immediately.

---

## 6. Emergency Measures

Emergency governance may:

- Pause certain protocol functions
- Delay upgrades
- Mitigate active exploit conditions

Constraints:

- Strict scope limitations
- Transparent logging
- Post-incident review required

Emergency authority must not become permanent authority.

---

## 7. Upgrade Activation

Upgrades must:

- Be versioned
- Be announced in advance
- Include activation block height
- Be backward compatible where possible

Nodes must explicitly upgrade.

No silent forced upgrades.

---

## 8. Governance Evolution

Early phase:
- Validator-driven governance

Later phase:
- Increased token holder participation
- Potential on-chain voting modules

Decentralization roadmap must be transparent.

---

## 9. Transparency Requirements

Governance must include:

- Public proposal archive
- Voting records
- Clear upgrade history
- Changelog documentation

---

## 10. Decisions Required for v0.2

- Governance voting model selection
- Approval thresholds
- Voting duration
- Activation delay duration
- Emergency authority structure
